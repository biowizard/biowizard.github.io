A lot of bioinformatics software is powerful and freely available, but has

* Complicated lists of parameters and arguments
* Documentation varying in quality from good to terrible to nonexistent
* a tendency to fail hours into a running job

Biowizard is built on a set of frequently used informatics tools including

1. samtools
1. bedtools
1. Cufflinks
1. STAR
1. MISO

Mostly, Biowizard is here to save you sanity and time. A week saved from banging your head against a tool is one week closer to publication.
