A lot of bioinformatics software is powerful and freely available, but have

* Difficult installation and upgrade processes
* Complicated lists of parameters and arguments
* Documentation varying in quality from good to terrible to nonexistent
* Failure conditions that only show up after running for hours
* Nonexistent or unhelpful error messages


Biowizard is built on a set of frequently used informatics tools including

1. samtools
1. bedtools
1. Cufflinks
1. STAR
1. MISO

Mostly, Biowizard is here to save you sanity and time.
